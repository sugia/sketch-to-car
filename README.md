This is a cs231n project. I contains code blocks of training conditional GAN. We have several models for comparison.

The car_edge_baseline.ipynb is a jupyter notebook to train a baseline model. It's built based on the pix2pix model.

The car_edge_inception.ipynb is a jupyter notebook to train a shallow conditional GAN with inception module.

The car_edge_inception_deep.ipynb is a jupyter notebook to train a deep conditional GAN with inception module.

## Here are some synthesized images for cars without background.
